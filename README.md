# 📧 Spam Mail Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam or not. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and a classification algorithm to accurately detect spam emails.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Spam Mail Prediction.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data exploration
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model building
  - Model evaluation
  - Conclusion

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
  
## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Loading the email dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the structure and distribution of data.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: 
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.
   - Tokenization
   - Stemming/Lemmatization
4. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Using techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization.
5. **Model Building**: 
   - Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
6. **Evaluation**: 
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
7. **Prediction**: 
   - Making predictions on new/unseen emails.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved a high accuracy rate in distinguishing spam from non-spam emails.
- The model generalizes well to unseen data.
